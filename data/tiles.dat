# Tile configuration file
# loads the graphics from "tiles/*.bmp"

# The order in this list determines how the tiles overlap in the game.
# The first tile in this list will be on the bottom and the default tile, the last will be on top

# "tiletypes" are passable where as "obstructions" are not. Otherwise there is no difference between the two.
